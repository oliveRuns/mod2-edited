        <h3 class="tag t1">Chicken</h3>
        <p class="blocktext">Chickens are domestic or farm birds. The live span of a chicken is about 10 to 15
            years.
            The male is
            larger
            and more brightly colored than the female. This is common feature in birds. The males show off their
            colorful feathers to attract the females.
            A chicken has a comb on the head and two wattles under the neck. The male has a larger comb compared to
            the
            female. The male is called a rooster. The female is called a hen while the young are called chicks. The
            female is usually ready to lay her first eggs when she is around six months old. </p>

    <div class="div-bg beef">
        <h3 class="tag t2">Beef</h3>
        <p class="blocktext">Cow, in common parlance, a domestic bovine, regardless of sex and age, usually of the
            species Bos taurus.
            In
            precise usage, the name is given to mature females of several large mammals, including cattle (bovines),
            moose, elephants, sea lions, and whales.
            Domestic cows are one of the most common farm animals around the world, and the English language has
            several
            words to describe these animals at various ages. A baby cow is called a calf. A female calf is sometimes
            called a heifer calf and a male a bull calf.</p>

    <div class="div-bg sushi">
        <h3 class="tag t3">Sushi</h3>
        <p class="blocktext">The history of sushi began with Paddy Fields in Asia, where fish was fermented with
            rice
            vinegar, salt
            and
            rice, after which the rice was discarded. The dish is today known as narezushi, and was introduced to
            Japan
            around the Yayoi period.[1] In the Muromachi period, people began to eat the rice as well as the
            fish.[2]
            During the Edo period, vinegar rather than fermented rice began to be used. In pre-modern times and
            modern
            times, it has become a form of fast food strongly associated with Japanese culture.[3]</p>
